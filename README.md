# Things to remember!
1. At the transmitter glove do not use voltage more than 5V else you'll burn up the lilypad.
2. At the receiver end pls use a voltage of 5V-12V for the motor driver to ensure proper functioning of the motors.
3. Make sure that all the wires and connections are properly done else you may not get the accurate and speedy resonse.
